# 3D Custom T-Shirt Renderer 🎨👕

Welcome to our 3D Custom T-Shirt Renderer project! This innovative application allows you to visualize a T-shirt in 3D according to your mood, style, or brand. You can manually upload pictures or logos to display on the T-shirt. Plus, we're working on a feature that will let you generate AI images to apply to it. In the future, you'll also have the option to buy your customized shirt directly from the app!

## Features 🚀

- **3D T-Shirt Rendering:** Get a realistic view of how your T-shirt will look.
- **Custom Uploads:** Upload your own images or logos to see them on the T-shirt.
- **AI Image Generation:** (Coming Soon) Generate unique images using AI to apply to your T-shirt.
- **Purchase Option:** (Future Feature) Buy the customized T-shirt you've designed.
